# Template syntax

Derbyâ€™s template syntax is loosely based on [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), a popular semantic templating language that extends [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).

Semantic templates better enforce separation of logic from presentation by restricting the ability to embed logic within views. Instead of allowing arbitrary code, there are a small set of template expressions. During rendering, data is passed to the template, and template expressions are replaced with the appropriate values. This data is often referred to as the "context." In Derby, there is a single model object for a given client, and this model is the data context.

Instead of custom expression types, Derby supports calling controller functions and the full JavaScript expression syntax. Expressions are parsed with [Esprima](http://esprima.org/) and do not use JavaScript `eval()` or `new Function()`.

## Whitespace and comments

Before parsing, all HTML comments, leading and trailing whitespace, and new lines are removed from templates. This reduces page size, and it keeps template code more readable when spaces are not desired between inline elements. This cannot be disabled in development, since whitespace between inline elements is significant for rendering of text and inline or inline-block elements.

If you do want whitespace at the beginning or end or a line, add the non-standard `&sp;` character entity, which is replaced with a space. You can avoid whitespace minification for a view by specifying the `unminified` option.

```derby
<Body:>
  <view is="person-data"></view>

<person-data: unminified>
  <script type="application/x-yaml">
    firstName: {{firstName}}
    lastName: {{lastName}}
  </script>
```

HTML comments are removed, expect for those with square brackets immediately inside of them. This syntax is used by Internet Explorer's conditional comments. It can also be used to include comments for copyright notices or the like.

```derby
<Body:>
  <!-- The following comment is not removed: -->
  <!--[if IE]><p>You are using Internet Explorer.</p><![endif]-->
  <!--[Neither is this one]-->
```

## HTML conformance

With the exception of templates that return strings and the contents of `<script>` and `<style>` elements, Derby templates must conform to HTML rules.

Templates are first parsed as HTML and transformed into Template objects. These Template objects can directly create HTML for server rendering or DOM nodes for client rendering. Derby does not do string interpolation of HTML and does not use innerHTML to update the page in the client.

#### Invalid template expression placements
```derby
<!-- INVALID: Within element names -->
<{{tagName}}>Bad bad!</{{tagName}}>

<!-- INVALID: Within attribute names -->
<b {{attrName}}="confused" {{booleanAttr}}>Bad bad!</b>

<!-- INVALID: Splitting an html tag -->
<b{{if maybe}}>Bad bad!</b{{/}}>

<!-- INVALID: Splitting an element -->
{{if maybe}}<b>{{/}}Bad bad!</b>
```

#### Valid placements
```derby
<!-- Within text -->
Let's go <b>{{activity}}</b>!

<!-- Within attribute values -->
<b style="color:{{displayColor}}">
  Let's go running!
</b>

<!-- Completely surrounding elements or text -->
{{if maybe}}
  <b>Let's go dancing!</b>
{{/if}}
```

Derby's HTML parser is quite simple, so you must write valid HTML, you must close all tags that are optionally self-closing such as `<p>` and `<li>`, and you must explicity write out implied elements, such as a `<tbody>` within a `<table>`. Supporting the full complexity of HTML5 parsing rules would add extra overhead without any substantive benefit.

HTML attribute values only need to be quoted if they are the empty string or if they contain a space, equals sign, or greater than sign. Derby parses unquoted attributes correctly, but always using double quotes around all attribute values is recommended.
